<p>It is a game of solving space puzzles via unreal 3 engines. As a middle school student, I was so deeply impressed by a PSP game called Echochrome that I managed to design via space a puzzle-solving game called SPACE.</p>

<p>The most important part of SPACE is its controllably moving stages and long-distance gangplank. Because the game was placed in a complicated space, the specific position of moving stages is affected by the player’s eye shot. With its complicated structuring, the game always perplexes the player unguided by a good lens. In the beginning, my friends felt rather perplexed in playing the game, because they did not know where changes came from after starting the gear. Thus, I devised many sub-lens to hint the player about changes on space structuring. For example, when a stage is moved, a sub-lens will be triggered to stretch the camera so that the player knows where the space structuring is changing. This has made the whole game process much easier and smoother.</p>

<p>In designing the game SPACE, I have realized that players’ more than designers’ experience should be focused in designing games. Otherwise, players will be perplexed. Therefore, in designing a good game, players’ experience should never be over-emphasized.</p>

<p>Although computer games designed by companies are becoming more and more complicated and increasing in their game parts, a good game does not necessarily need to have abundant game parts. In my opinion, as long as it is uniquely designed, a simple game can be listed as GOOD. With this perspective, I have managed to design a 2D AVG game called α.</p>

<p>The most basic operations in playing α are moving up and down, left and right, skipping, emitting bullets and space transmission which is the most importance operation. Focused on space transmissions I have designed many obstacles such as walls which can be passed through by bullets. A man can pass through these walls only if he resorts to space transmission. There walls have two forms and during their rainbow form, even bullets cannot pass through. And, space transmission is limited because it can only reach as far as 9 distance units. Under this circumstance, I have designed a regularly-movable platform, which works with various gear puzzles to increase the fun in playing α .</p>

<p>During the process of game designing, I have learnt to lead the player via the game itself as well as the story board. Besides, I have managed to make the whole game-playing process funny and interesting by controlling the game rhythm with stage plans. Most of all, I have realized that it has turned out a great success to polish a simple thing to its utmost.</p>

		<p>Is it game or it is art? I keep pondering over this question while playing, or should I say enjoying, the superb game, Journey. As I marvel at the imaginative storyline, majestic graphics and magnificent music, I cannot help but wonder when I would design a game equally amazing. However, in China, many people hold prejudice towards game design due to lack of knowledge of this field. Worse still, game design in China is underdeveloped and the techniques are in dire need of updating. Growing up, I have been heavily influenced by classic games such as Last of Us and Uncharted by Naughty Dog. To me, games are a visual art with deep and diverse attributes, where visuals, music, narrative, gamers’ experience and realism of the game all carry a big weight. My eternal enthusiasm for game design propelled me to embark on a career in this industry, and further, contribute my part to promote the development of game design in China.</p>

<p>As much as I love game design and aspire to gain systematical body of theories and techniques, there were not many options for students who aim to major in game design. During four years of undergraduate study in E-commerce, the curriculum primarily enabled me to set up a robust foundation of computer knowledge and skills. Courses like Network Programming Language, C Language, Commerce Websites and System Design and Development, etc. familiarized me with C++, Java, SQL, ERP, and Photoshop. All of these facilitated my practices in the field of game design. Besides, courses like Internet Marketing also helped me form a comprehensive understanding of Internet marketing, which will benefit me when I deal with promotion of games in the future. In this respect, my graduation project “Analysis on the Predicament of Want Want China’s Internet Marketing Strategies and Countermeasures” further deepened my comprehension of marketing. Expanding channel of distribution, raising product’s added value and optimizing market prices were the recommendations I put forward in the paper. I believe marketing strategies will aid me greatly as promotion is a vital link in game design; and this is especially true in China.</p>

		<p>n the 1980’s, designer of FC games focused much more attention on stage projecting instead of picturing or plotting. SUPER MARIO BROS was a globally popular FC game typical in this context. As for why it came out on top among all the FC games, I think there are mainly three reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hidden parts</li>
</ul>


<p>All the hidden parts in SUPER MARIO BROS, like awards hidden in bricks, hidden rooms, hidden stage-breading channels and shortcuts, are exciting and haunted for the player to find, just as they are ready to find a new island.</p>

<ul>
<li>Well-designed traps and skipping platforms</li>
</ul>


<p>Skipping is the most basic operation the player can use when playing SUPER MARIO BROS. The simple operation skipping can be so attractive to the player mainly due to designing of playforms in different stages. Distance and height between every two stages are precisely calculated and repeatedly experimented. Working with various traps and platforms combined at will, movable  platforms and gears, and monstors‘ obstruction, they make up of a series of obstacles, which add to the challenges and interest in playing SUPER MARIO BROS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Highly-effective modularized stage designing</li>
</ul>


<p>There are only four main stages in SUPER MARIO BROS, which include forest, sewer, castle and underwater. However, terrain variation, monstor upgrading and time change between day and night in every stage lead to a 8-stage design. Taking the castle for instance, in its early stage there are few gears, traps and enemies, the buffering margin is high and the room for operation mistakes is large. While in the late stage, one mimor mistake will lead to the player’s beginning the game totally again and even being trapped in a maze of infinite experimenting. Despite of all these similar parts, SUPER MARIO BROS places the player under different challenges whenever he begins a new stage.</p>
