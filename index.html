		<p>Is it game or it is art? I keep pondering over this question while playing, or should I say enjoying, the superb game, Journey. As I marvel at the imaginative storyline, majestic graphics and magnificent music, I cannot help but wonder when I would design a game equally amazing. However, in China, many people hold prejudice towards game design due to lack of knowledge of this field. Worse still, game design in China is underdeveloped and the techniques are in dire need of updating. Growing up, I have been heavily influenced by classic games such as Last of Us and Uncharted by Naughty Dog. To me, games are a visual art with deep and diverse attributes, where visuals, music, narrative, gamers’ experience and realism of the game all carry a big weight. My eternal enthusiasm for game design propelled me to embark on a career in this industry, and further, contribute my part to promote the development of game design in China.</p>

<p>As much as I love game design and aspire to gain systematical body of theories and techniques, there were not many options for students who aim to major in game design. During four years of undergraduate study in E-commerce, the curriculum primarily enabled me to set up a robust foundation of computer knowledge and skills. Courses like Network Programming Language, C Language, Commerce Websites and System Design and Development, etc. familiarized me with C++, Java, SQL, ERP, and Photoshop. All of these facilitated my practices in the field of game design. Besides, courses like Internet Marketing also helped me form a comprehensive understanding of Internet marketing, which will benefit me when I deal with promotion of games in the future. In this respect, my graduation project “Analysis on the Predicament of Want Want China’s Internet Marketing Strategies and Countermeasures” further deepened my comprehension of marketing. Expanding channel of distribution, raising product’s added value and optimizing market prices were the recommendations I put forward in the paper. I believe marketing strategies will aid me greatly as promotion is a vital link in game design; and this is especially true in China.</p>
