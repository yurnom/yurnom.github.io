	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Is it game or it is art? I keep pondering over this question while playing, or should I say enjoying, the superb game, Journey. As I marvel at the imaginative storyline, majestic graphics and magnificent music, I cannot help but wonder when I would design a game equally amazing. However, in China, many people hold prejudice towards game design due to lack of knowledge of this field. Worse still, game design in China is underdeveloped and the techniques are in dire need of updating. Growing up, I have been heavily influenced by classic games such as Last of Us and Uncharted by Naughty Dog. To me, games are a visual art with deep and diverse attributes, where visuals, music, narrative, gamers’ experience and realism of the game all carry a big weight. My eternal enthusiasm for game design propelled me to embark on a career in this industry, and further, contribute my part to promote the development of game design in China.</p>

<p>As much as I love game design and aspire to gain systematical body of theories and techniques, there were not many options for students who aim to major in game design. During four years of undergraduate study in E-commerce, the curriculum primarily enabled me to set up a robust foundation of computer knowledge and skills. Courses like Network Programming Language, C Language, Commerce Websites and System Design and Development, etc. familiarized me with C++, Java, SQL, ERP, and Photoshop. All of these facilitated my practices in the field of game design. Besides, courses like Internet Marketing also helped me form a comprehensive understanding of Internet marketing, which will benefit me when I deal with promotion of games in the future. In this respect, my graduation project “Analysis on the Predicament of Want Want China’s Internet Marketing Strategies and Countermeasures” further deepened my comprehension of marketing. Expanding channel of distribution, raising product’s added value and optimizing market prices were the recommendations I put forward in the paper. I believe marketing strategies will aid me greatly as promotion is a vital link in game design; and this is especially true in China.</p>

<p>It was during my internships that I gained a real understanding of game play through firsthand engagement in the projects. Initially, my understanding of game play was just drawing pictures coupled with programming. The internships taught me that game is closely related to life. It takes a wide range of expertise and profound insights to design a perfect game. For instance, script and narrative skills are necessary for the plot design; cinematic techniques are required if there are animations; as for music, a designer should possess knowledge of songwriting. During my first internship at GA Game &amp; Education, I for the first time participated in a series of activities related to game design. Not only did I develop useful skills, but also made friends of similar ideals and beliefs. It was then that I realized that cooperation and team work were just as essential as skills. Only when all members of the same team maintain good communications, can the project stay on the right track. This rewarding experience reinforced my resolution to devote my life to game design.</p>

<p>In 2015, I interned at Epic Games where I was highly involved in the designing process of four key projects, namely Ash’s Wars, Titan’s Heart, α，and Water Margin Heroes. During this process, I achieved unprecedentedly rapid growth as I tried my hand at every type of work in game design. For Ash’s Wars and Titan’s Heart, I was mainly responsible for the planning of copywriting and game system, which made me realize the importance of scheming in game design. The setup of the world, chronicles, and forces as well as the design of scenes, characters, numerical system and system tasks took a lot of efforts, deliberation and creativity. As I established the key elements in the game, I think I also built a world of curiosity and great appeal. Working in teams of seven and five, I also trained my teamwork ability and communicative skills. Later, under the instruction of Cheng Xue at Epic Games, I used Unreal Engine 3 to develop a 2d AVG game, in which players control a robot that can transmit a messenger. The flight distance of the messenger is three game units. Revolving around this element, a large amount of game scenes was designed, and thereby I designed many NPC enemies to control the pace of the game. In Water Margin Heroes, I took on the role of the Numerical Game Designer. Under the instruction of Zhang Heng from Ubisoft China Shanghai branch, I designed a MOBA games based on 108 Water Margin heroes. To balance the entire game, I referred to many classic MOBA games and designed the skills of the ten martial generals from the perspectives of effects, range and harm of skills. Throughout the whole process, I gradually became more experienced in terms of techniques, and gained a thorough understanding of the overall procedure as well as nuanced details of game design.</p>

<p>Internship at Epic Games granted me knowledge and insights into this field. At the same time, it also exposed my weaknesses. Since I have not been professionally trained before, I took many game design courses such as Internet Game Design, Mobile Game Design, Basics of Programming, Basics of Fine Art, Game Development, etc. All of those courses infused me with all the knowledge I need to know and opened my eyes to the real game design industry. During my time there, I also participated in the 2015 ChinaJoy Gaming Exhibition at B2B section with our game Global Mission.</p>

<p>My internship at Beijing FingerSky Internet Tech Company Limited elevated me on a different level. I fully engaged in nearly all the essential links in the design of the demo of VR game The Adventures of Three Tomb Raiders for 2016 ChinaJoy Gaming Exhibition. I firstly set up the battle procedures for the demo, when I determined that there would be four battles and set up a specific number of monsters and the entire battle field. According to the original novels, I designed the monsters, conducted scene optimization, compiled the rules for random map generation, designed modules of core scenes, made sound effects and ran debug. Further, I touched upon the economic side of game design. On the basis of the mind map of the game design offered by our lead designer, I determined the economic source, established the economic model and drew the economic output consumption curve according to the life cycle of the games. Lastly, I also analyzed the factors affecting the VR experience, frame rate, latency, and resolution. My opinion was that we could only solve these issues through the game design instead of hardware. To avoid dizziness, we should give gamers self-controlled angle of view and eliminate dizziness-triggering scenes. With guidance from professionals and top-notched designers in this industry, I now have adopted the mindset of game designers and equipped myself with sufficient skills to aid me in breaking into this endlessly intriguing industry.</p>

<p>My internships undoubtedly improved my professional competence. In college, I also actively participated in a set of extracurricular activities which were in one way or another related to game design. For instance, I engaged in the stage design of night gala and gave full play to my edge of aesthetics and creative power. Besides, I am passionate to join in the big force of volunteers. Aside from volunteering in activities such as anniversary of the founding of our college, I particularly enjoyed visiting children with autism. Trying to build a connection with them was largely like building a world in a game. When the world is not yet built, the designing part can be extremely hard. However, the satisfaction brought by the end product is beyond words. I was glad I had brought joy to those children. In return, this experience also inspired me to design games for autistic children. Game can be a therapeutic outlet for dealing with our unique problems. It would be the upmost achievement if I can someday design a game for people with special needs.</p>

<p>The infinite charm of game design will forever fascinates me and so I would love to devote my whole life to this industry. I consider myself a man of a strong will. Though I did not have the opportunity to major in game design in my undergraduate study, I have been preparing for my graduate study since junior year by learning about computer and drawing. I plan to gain a more systematic understanding of this discipline and the United States is without a doubt the holy ground for this purpose. After careful research, I chose New York University as my ideal choice. With the guidance from your experienced faculty, flexible curriculum, and powerful network of alumni, I believe I can receive the best education there is in this field, and even step on the threshold of my career. By setting the ambition of becoming a competent game designer, I plan to acquire more in-depth knowledge and interact actively with professors and industry tycoons in my graduate study. After graduation, it is my plan to embark on my career as a planner in one of the big companies like Blizzard. In the long term, I aspire to become a producer and lead a team to design large scale console games exactly as I envision them to be. After accumulating enough experience, I will bring the new techniques and concepts back to China, realizing my self-value by contributing my own part in the development of game design.</p>
